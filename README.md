# Lunamod
A Fabric mod, that adds moon-themed items to the game, which get stronger at night.

### Why did I create this mod:
I started this project to get back into coding and it has helped me a lot to find motivation to code again. 
It has also taught me a ton about using the Fabric API and Minecraft modding in general.
